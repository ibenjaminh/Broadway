# Broadway Design - Layout Enhancement Project

Welcome to my project with Broadway Design, a fictional design firm whose landing page received a bit of a facelift, thanks to me and Codecademy. This was an on-platform project that allowed me to delve deep into the intricacies of CSS, focusing on display and position properties to enhance the site's layout.

## What's the Deal with Broadway Design?

Broadway Design's landing page served as my canvas for this project. The challenge? To transform an okay layout into an exceptional one that not only captures the essence of the firm but also improves user experience. And how did I achieve this? By getting my hands dirty with CSS, specifically through the adept use of display and position properties.

## Why Focus on Display and Position?

- **Structuring the layout**: Ensuring content flows logically and efficiently.
- **Enhancing visual appeal**: Making the site not just functional but also visually engaging.
- **Improving navigation**: Guiding visitors seamlessly through the page.

## The Transformation Journey

### Codecademy as the Compass

Following Codecademy's step-by-step guidance, I embarked on this journey with a clear roadmap. The platform provided the foundational knowledge and challenges needed to apply theoretical concepts to practical scenarios.

### Mastering CSS Properties

- **Display**: I experimented with various display values such as block, inline, inline-block, and none to find the perfect arrangement for page elements.
- **Position**: I used position properties like static, relative, absolute, fixed, and sticky to meticulously place each element in its ideal location on the page.

Cheers,
